# FastAPI_API_Docker


A simple API made with FastAPI. I've dockerized the application so I could also use a PGadmin container.
I'll be updating this with more functionalities, such as:

- Login and Logout
- A billing system
- Improve basic CRUD methods

You can also run this locally, but the PGadmin container must be running so you can connect to the database. Please read the README file for more instructions
